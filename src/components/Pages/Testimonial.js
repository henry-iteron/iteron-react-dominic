              ITERON AG has developed a custom POS system specifically for our
              business. The team took an open-source system that had been shut
              down and redeveloped it for our company. It uses Ruby on Rails
              (Rails) as a framework. It’s pretty unique because it’s not just a
              POS system; it also has features for booking, events, servicing,
              rental, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team also integrated the system with our website. Using our
              site, customers can book and rebook sessions and upload their
              certifications to prove they’re qualified for their activities.
              That information is stored on the system, and we can turn it into
              a POS at the store. It basically combines retail sales with our
              services.

              ITERON AG was engaging as they gave their best to walk me through
              the nuances of the design. How the details we design now could
              potentially impact the future. The email automation using mailgun
              was a success. The setup of server with Digital Ocean also went
              well. All data migration from existing vendor to Iteron was done
              seamlessly. The site became super fast to use. I also found the
              developers highly skilled and friendly too.

              Furthermore, the additional benefits were mentoring support. The
              payment or their fees was secondary to them from the beginning as
              the Director did mention during our first meet, they have
              companies of all sizes as their client and they really like to
              work with early stage startups and not everything is about money.

              Our Product was supposed to be launched in 3 months as the
              academic year was starting. We had troubles with an existing
              Vendor and I searched ITERON through google. They impressed us
              with a POC and showed that they can deliver challenges. This is
              how our association started. ITERON kept its promise in delivering
              and completing the product launch on time.

              Though it was transitioned from an incumbent Vendor, the Team put

              areas, complete the open points and rollout. Although it was a big
              risk I took to change to ITERON three months before the product
              launch, they proved that I was not wrong in selecting them. If you

              We have been working with ITERON for the past 4 years and having
              been collaborating on various projects and applications. It has
              been a great experience for me and my Team to work with their
              development team as an integrated team and adhering the quality
              standards and schedule expectations. Their expertise in elixir and
              erlang had given a good leverage to some of the critical

              offshore Team. Our applications had quite a complex architecture

              Ich arbeite seit 2017 mit ITERON zusammen. Am Anfang war ich etwas
              besorgt darüber, wie die Offshore-Modellierung funktionieren
              würde, aber zu meiner Überraschung halfen uns die Prozessstandards
              und Methoden, die ITERON eingeführt hat, einwandfrei mit dem
              Offshore-Team zu arbeiten. Sie helfen uns bei der
              Applikation-entwicklung und beim Support. Das Team lässt sich je
              nach unseren Bedürfnissen vergrössern und verkleinern, und diese
              Flexibilität hilft mir, die Business Roadmap gut zu planen.
