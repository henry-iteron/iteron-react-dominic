              ITERON AG has developed a custom POS system specifically for our
              business. The team took an open-source system that had been shut
              down and redeveloped it for our company. It uses Ruby on Rails
              (Rails) as a framework. It’s pretty unique because it’s not just a
              POS system; it also has features for booking, events, servicing,
              rental, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team also integrated the system with our website. Using our
              site, customers can book and rebook sessions and upload their
              certifications to prove they’re qualified for their activities.
              That information is stored on the system, and we can turn it into
              a POS at the store. It basically combines retail sales with our
              services.

              ITERON AG was engaging as they gave their best to walk me through
              the nuances of the design. How the details we design now could
              potentially impact the future. The email automation using mailgun
              was a success. The setup of server with Digital Ocean also went
              well. All data migration from existing vendor to Iteron was done
              seamlessly. The site became super fast to use. I also found the
              developers highly skilled and friendly too.

            <p>
              Furthermore, the additional benefits were mentoring support. The
              payment or their fees was secondary to them from the beginning as
              the Director did mention during our first meet, they have
              companies of all sizes as their client and they really like to
              work with early stage startups and not everything is about money.

              We engaged with ITERON from the start of the project for our LMS

              requirement discussions. They always keeps us informed not only
              about the progress they are making week on week but also about the
              pitfalls found during the development stage and the solution for
              the same which makes our job easier.

          <p>Our engagement with ITERON began following a strategic decision to transition the application development and support of SAAS email campaign testing platform Touchstone from our internal IT Team. ITERON managed the transition smoothly and cost effectively with minimum impact on our day to day Business.</p>
          <p>The team ITERON assigned to the Project is professional and committed delivering high service levels. 2 years on from our initial engagement we consider ITERON to be a key part of our IT roadmap.</p>
          <p>We are very happy with the partnership</p>
